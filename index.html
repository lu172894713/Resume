            <p>
                I always thought my dream was to work in the computer field. Ever since I was a kid, computer operating systems or software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of a Windows computer and spending a day figuring out how to use the system. When I was in college, I learned JavaScript, python, C++, Linux, and HTML because I could learn more in computer fields. I was insatiable.
So, now, I graduated, this passion remains with me. There's undoubtedly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and eventually more to build in my future. And for this, I am very appreciative.
